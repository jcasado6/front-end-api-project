## Description & Features
This MERN, full-stack application was built in conjuction with my [brewery-tracker-api](https://github.com/jcasado6/api-project) as the back-end. The front-end, built with React.js, has full CRUD capability in order to track and store your favorite breweries.  

The back-end utilizes MongoDB as the database to store your respective brewery information. More details on the back-end can be found [here](https://github.com/jcasado6/api-project). The forms and tables were created and styled with bootstrap.

## Getting Started

* Fork and clone the repository and open the code in your preferred text editor.
* In your terminal or through your text editor's terminal, execute the command 
###### `npm start` 
* A new page in your browser will open and you can begin to interact with the application. 

## Goals
In the future, I would like to improve this project by...
* Creating a new component that can be clicked to view each individuals brewery's information
* Implementing a user login page
* Adding other features such as the brewery's location displayed on a map utilizing a map API, a column where the user can add their favorite beers from the respective brewery, and ranking system for beers and breweries.
